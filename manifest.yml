  This app will launch an [RStudio Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server/) instance on a FAS RC compute node.
  The base image is [bioconductor/bioconductor_docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker) with additional software from [rocker/tidyverse and rocker/verse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse).

  * Bioconductor 3.10 has the [Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) for improved performance of some R routines, a [zlib compression library optimized with Intel Integrated Performance Primitives](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-to-use-zlib-with-intel-ipp-optimization), as well as several R packages used by FAS Informatics.
  * Bioconductor 3.12 adds [rocker/geospatial](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial).
  * Bioconductor 3.13 adds [RStudio v1.4 Python Support](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/10/07/rstudio-v1-4-preview-python-support/).

  This image provides a common software environment for FAS Informatics workshops and general-purpose single-node RStudio Server jobs.
  FAS RC environment modules and Slurm are *not* accessible from this instance.
  For the FAS RC RStudio Server with environment module and Slurm support, see *Interactive Apps > Servers > RStudio Server*

  User-installed R libraries will be installed in *~/R/ifxrstudio/\<IMAGE_TAG\>*.
