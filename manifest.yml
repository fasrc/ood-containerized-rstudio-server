  This app will launch an [RStudio Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server/) instance on a FAS RC compute node.
  The base image is [bioconductor/bioconductor_full](https://hub.docker.com/r/bioconductor/bioconductor_full) with additional software from [rocker/tidyverse and rocker/verse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse), as well as several R packages used by FAS Informatics.

  This image provides a common software environment for FAS Informatics workshops and general-purpose single-node RStudio Server jobs.
  FAS RC environment modules and Slurm are *not* accessible from this instance.
  For the FAS RC RStudio Server with environment module and Slurm support, see *Interactive Apps > Servers > RStudio Server*

  User-installed R libraries will be installed in *~/R/ifxrstudio/\<R_VERSION\>*.
